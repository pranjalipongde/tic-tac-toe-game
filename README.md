Customizable Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This project is a customizable Tic-Tac-Toe game built using React.js. The game allows users to define the grid size (n x n) and win streak (m) before starting. The app is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring an enjoyable experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

Features
Customizable Game Settings:

Users can set the grid size (minimum 3x3, maximum 10x10).
Users can define the win streak (minimum 3).
The game prevents starting if the win streak exceeds the grid size.
Interactive Gameplay:

Players alternate between "X" and "O" turns.
The game checks for winning conditions after each move.
Displays the winner or announces a draw if the board is filled with no winner.
Responsive Design:

The layout and components adapt to different screen sizes.
Optimized for mobile devices with smooth interactions and scalable UI.

Tech Stack
React.js for building the UI components and managing state.
CSS for styling the game and making it responsive.
Vite for fast development and bundling.

Responsive Design
The game is fully responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes. Below are some key features of the responsive design:

Mobile View: On small screens (below 600px), the board and input fields shrink appropriately for easy interaction on mobile devices.
Desktop View: On larger screens, the board is centered, and components are scaled to provide a balanced layout.

Project Highlights
Dynamic Grid Creation: The board size adjusts dynamically based on the userâ€™s input.
Win Streak Check: The game uses efficient algorithms to check for a win based on the customizable grid and win streak.
Responsive UI: The layout adjusts seamlessly to fit various device sizes, ensuring a smooth user experience.
